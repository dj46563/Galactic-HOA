Less is more

- Game where you rush around to drop everything in your inventory
 - Interact with other players to either pass them something or mutally remove something

- De-cluttering your room

- mutiplayer party match where you need to keep your area as clean as possible
 - Could be like leaf blowers or something
 - Or different types of items require methods of removal
 - Other people are moving stuff out of their area and into yours
 - leafs and rocks

- Circle system
 - Smooth out the segment creation and deletion
 - Make a nicer map sprite
- networked movement
 - Interp the postions
 - Don't send unchanged positions
- leafs and leaf blower
- give robot guide a mustache

Game States:
- Waiting for players
- Pre-round (walk onto the circle to join)
- Game
 - Start: circle flying up "cutscene" with leave generation
 - End: circle returns, scores are set

TODO:
- Reduce bytes sent for leaf rotation
- Show round count in scoreboard

BUGS:
- Animations are jank, sometimes incorrect
- Jenn from original tab couldnt see her second player
- Movement is kind of choppy

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Create base class for Server and Client PeerData so that state machine can access
  common fields (see GetCategoriesOfPlayer)
- On and Off circle just need to be hashsets of ids?
- A more extendable way to do the state machine id's
- Cache leaf controllers for leaf blower
- Improve handeling of joining players while circle is lifting off
- Seperate jovis paint and outlines so that coloring him doesnt darken the outline
